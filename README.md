Hello world

1. Because the r, g, b values are supposed to be fractional numbers between 0 and 1, so they belong to the float type of variables.
2. Because the number of bounces is supposed to be a whole number, so it belongs to the int type of variables.
3. The line missed the semicolon at the end of the line, which is supposed to act as a mark to the end of a whole line.

1. Table 7. The parameters (input) are an integer value that represents the player's current friendship level with the character (int friendshipLevel) and a boolean value that represents whether the player knows the character's secret (boolean knowsSecret). The return type (output) is a string variable that is the text response to the player's dialogue choice (string characterResponse).
2. If each Component is a robot, then class is the blueprint to produce the robot, member variables are traits of the certain type of robot (size, material, etc.) and methods are the robot's functions (sweeping the floor, cleaning the table, etc.)
3. Every time the ball's speed reaches over _speedThreshold, the ball's renderer's color values multiplies by 1.5, and as we know the higher the values r, g, b are, the brighter the color of the renderer is. And since the method is multiplying all three values at the same time, it gets infinitely close to 1,1,1 (pure white).
